// O(log n): Algorithm for Binary Search
// O(log n) Time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithmically with the size of the input (represented by n).
// In simple terms, as the input size increases, the time taken to execute the algorithm increases slowly, but exponentially.

// what does exponentially mean?
// It means that the rate of increase in the time taken to execute the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input.
// For example, if the input size increases by a factor of 10, the time taken to execute the algorithm increases by a factor of 10.

// Binary search is a search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array.
