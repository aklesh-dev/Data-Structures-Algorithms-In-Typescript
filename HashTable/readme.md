# What is Hash Table?
- Data structure use to store key-value pairs.

## Hash Function.
- Acts like a translator, taking an input of any size(key) and converting it into a fixed-sized value(hash code) that can be used as an index within the hash table's internal array. This process of mapping arbitrary keys to fixed-length indices is called hashing. 

1. `Input` ðŸ‘‰ You feed any kind of data into the hash function, like your name, a sentence, or a whole file.

2. `Hashing process` ðŸ‘‰ The function performs a series of mathematical operation on the input data, essentially scrambling it up in a unique wa.

3. `Fixed-Sized-Output` ðŸ‘‰ Regradless of input size, the hash function always spits out a fixed-sized value, like a short string of characters or a number.
