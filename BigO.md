## What is bigO

#### Big O notation helps us understand `how long` an algorithm will take to run or `how much` memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows.

- How long an algorithm take to run, it's called `Time Complexity`.
- How much memory it need as the amount of data it handles grows, it's called `Space Complexity`

### O(n)

- Specifies that the execution time of an algorithm grows <span style="background-color:blue; border-radius:5px; padding:1px;">linearly</span> in proportion to the size of the <span class="highlight">input data</span>(n).

- As the number of items in the input data increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run increase crosspondingly.

### O(1)
- Specifies that the execution time of an algorithm does not depend on the size of the input data.

- The time taken by the algorithm remains `constant` regardless of the size of the input data.
