# What is Stack?
- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in various applications, such as parsing expressions, managing function calls in programming languages, and undo mechanisms in software applications.

- The two primary operations associated with stacks are:

1. Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removing the element from the top of the stack.

- There are different ways to implement a stack, such as using arrays or linked lists. Each method has its own advantages and trade-offs in terms of memory usage and performance.
